# Not TMO19 Logo
This is not a 19th Thailand Mathematics Olympiad Logo (but I did submitted and didn't pass the first round)
The logo was made in Adobe Illustrator 2022, since it's the requirement of the competition

### Submissions

I submitted two files on submission:

**TMOFinal.pdf** -- This contains the logo that *would* be used if it get submitted.

## Intended Philosophy

### Inspiration and Core Principles 
- The logo represents collaboration of all of the maths community and also the symbol sigma, meaning that maths is the result of the world's collaboration. 
- The logo theme colour represents Thailand, the host of the event and the place which is situated in. ● The “O” in the logo represents the pride of mathematics (represented as a medal). 
- The logo uses the font ‘Kanit’, which represents the core principle of the universe and maths, it is also modern and easy to read representing Thailand's modernity.
- The “T” extends and covers the rest of the logo, representing the house, the place where this competition will be held. 
 
### Design Point Identity Guidelines 
1. This Logo Represents Thailand 
- The “T” in the logo represents the country, “Thailand”. The “T” extends and covers the rest of the logo, representing the house, the place where this competition will be held. 
2. This Logo Represents Mathematics 
- This logo uses the font Kanit, which in english means Math which is represents the core nature of the universe 
- The second character in this logo, the “M” is designed in a way that resembles the Sigma in math, which conveys the meaning that the math community is united 
- The “M” is also divided into 2 halves with different colors, pink and blue. Which, if looked at carefully, looks like two person holding each other’s hand 
3. This Logo Represents the School 
- The other two main color seen in this logo is the use of pink and blue color, which is the color scheme of the school that’s going to hold this competition, SK or “Suankularb Wittayalai School” 
4. This Logo Represents the TMO Competition 
- The third character in this logo, the “O” is designed to represent the medal. Also conveys the meaning of mathematics pride, the medal that’s going to be given to the olympiads.
